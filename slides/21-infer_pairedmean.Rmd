# Paired Designs

How would you collect data to answer the following questions?

- You want to compare grocery prices between Vons and Trader Joe's. Are prices different, on average?
- You want to test "The Freshmen 10" theory. Do college students gain, on average, 10 pounds during their first year?

## Reducing variability

- The paired data sets in this chapter have *one pair of quantitative response values for each observational unit,* allowing for a built-in comparison. 
- Studies with paired data *remove individual variability* by looking at the difference score for each individual. 
- Reducing variability in data improves inferences:
    + Narrower confidence intervals
    + Smaller p-values when the null hypothesis is false (more power)

# 21.1 Randomization test for the mean paired difference

Example: Compare tread wear between two brands of tire.

- 25 cars. Each car had one tire of each brand.
- After 1000 miles, the tread reamaining was measured.

## {data-background-image="https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/21-inference-paired-means_files/figure-html/tiredata-1.png" data-background-size="contain"}

## Hypotheses

- $H_0: \mu_\text{diff} = 0$, the average tread wear is the same for the two tire brands.
- $H_A: \mu_\text{diff} \neq 0$, the average tread wear is different across the two tire brands.

*Observed Statistic:* $\bar{x}_\text{diff} = -0.002$
 
. . .

**Randomization:** Flip a coin for each pair. If heads, reverse the pair. If tails, leave it as is.

## Preview

<div class="column-left">
Which common exercise, jumping jacks or bicycle kicks, raises your heart rate more?

\[
\begin{align}
H_0: \mu_d &= 0 \\
H_a: \mu_d &\neq 0 \\
\bar{x}_d &\approx 11.9545

jjbike <- read.table("http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/data/chap7/JJvsBicycle.txt", header=TRUE)

## Group Activity

1. Go to the [Matched Pairs applet](http://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/MatchedPairs/MatchedPairs.htm?hideExtras=1), and select the `JJvsBicycle` data from the dropdown menu. Discuss the following: 
    + In the top graph, what do the red dots, blue dots, and gray lines represent?
    + In the bottom graph, what do the dots represent? 

2. Check the box for *Randomize* and then click on the Randomize button.
    + What do the coin flips determine? 
    + How is the dot on the null distribution calculated?

3. Perform 1000 (or more) randomizations, and **record** a *p-value* for the above test. In the context of the problem (exercise), **record** a sentence saying what this p-value tells us.

# 21.2 Bootstrap confidence interval for the mean paired difference

- Bootstrapping works the same as in the one-mean case.
- Resample the data, and compute bootstrapped $\bar{x}_\text{diff}$'s.
- Make a bootstrapped distribution.

# 21.3 Mathematical model for the mean paired difference

```{r include=FALSE}
textbooks <- ucla_textbooks_f18 %>% 
  select(subject, course_num, bookstore_new, amazon_new) %>%
  mutate(price_diff = bookstore_new - amazon_new) %>%
  filter(!is.na(bookstore_new) & !is.na(amazon_new)) 
```

*Example.* Data on 68 textbooks, giving their bookstrore price and their price on Amazon.

```{r}
glimpse(textbooks)
```

## 21.3.1 Observed data

```{r, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(textbooks, aes(x = price_diff)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)
```

## 21.3.2 Variability of the statistic

```{r}
textbooks %>%
  summarize(n = n(),
            meanDiff = mean(price_diff),
            sdDiff = sd(price_diff))
```

## Hypotheses

- $H_0: \mu_\text{diff} = 0$, there is no difference in the average textbook price between the bookstore and Amazon
- $H_A: \mu_\text{diff} \neq 0$, there is a difference in the average price.


## 21.3.3 Observed statistic vs. null statistics

The mathematical model is very similar to the one-mean case:

$$
T = \frac{\bar{x}_\text{diff} - 0}{s_\text{diff}/\sqrt{n}}
$$

The conditions are similar: Independence, large samples, or normality of the differences.

## Confidence interval for the mean difference

A confidence interval for $\mu_\text{diff}$ is:

$$
\bar{x}_\text{diff} \pm t^\star_\text{df} \times \frac{s_\text{diff}}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

As before, $df = n-1$. Use `qt()` to get $t^\star$.


# Group Exercise

```{r echo=FALSE}
textbooks %>%
  summarize(n = n(),
            meanDiff = mean(price_diff),
            sdDiff = sd(price_diff))
```

1. Use the mathematical model to perform the above hypothesis test. Obtain a $T$ score using the formula and a P-value using `pt()`. Write a sentence explaining your conclusion in context.

2. Use the mathematical model to construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean difference in price between the bookstore and Amazon. Write a sentence interpreting your confidence interval in context.

# Paired t-test in R

## Have R compute the differences

```{r}
t.test(textbooks$bookstore_new, textbooks$amazon_new, paired = TRUE)
```


## Just to a one-sample test on the differences

```{r}
t.test(textbooks$price_diff)
```
