R and RStudio are both free and open-source. Please install them on your laptop as described below.

## Step 1: Install R

The installer is here: https://cran.rstudio.com/

Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system. The latest release of R is 4.3.1 (Beagle Scouts). 

- Mac users: pay attention to the MacOS prerequisites, and choose the appropriate version for your system (Apple silicon (M1/M2) arm64 or Intel). R version 4.3.1 requires MacOS 11 or greater. If you have an older version of MacOS, consider upgrading your operating system to at least MacOS 11.
- Windows users: [Download R-4.3.1 for Windows](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/) and execute the .exe file. 
- Linux users: R can often be found using the package manager (e.g., see [these instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-r-on-ubuntu-22-04) for getting the latest version of R for Ubuntu.)

## Step 2: Install RStudio

Once you have installed R, you can install RStudio Desktop using the installer that you can get here: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

Again, choose the appropriate installer. 

- Mac Users: Notice that the latest version of RStudio requires MacOS 11 or greater. If you have an older version of MacOS (e.g., 10.13), you should probably upgrade your operating system to at least MacOS 11. 

## Step 3: Test the installation and install some packages

When you launch RStudio for the first time, the interface should look something like this:

The **Console** pane on the left is where you can type commands and view their output. For example, if you type

```{r eval=FALSE}
2 + 2
```

in the console and hit the *enter* key, you should see the result in the console.

Install the `tidyverse` and `openintro` packages by executing the following command in the console.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("openintro", "tidyverse"), type = "binary")
```

This command will install several packages and data sets that we will use throughout the course. It might take a while to finish. If you encounter any error messages, take a screenshot and email me.

You can test these packages by executing the following commands in the console.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
ggplot(gpa_study_hours, aes(x = study_hours, y = gpa)) + geom_point()
```

If all went well, a scatterplot should appear in the **Plots** pane on the right.
