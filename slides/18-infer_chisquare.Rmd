# 18.1 Randomization test of independence

Can the type of question influence how much a seller reveals about defects?

- Explanatory: Question asked 
    - General: What can you tell me about it?
    - Positive Assumption: It does not have any problems, does it?
    - Negative Assumption: What problems does it have?

- Response: Does the seller disclose the problem?

## Two-way table

| Question             |  Disclose problem | 	Hide problem 	| Total | 
| -------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ----- |
| General 	            |   2              	| 71            |	73 |
| Positive assumption  |  23              	| 50            |	73 |
| Negative assumption  |  36              	| 37            |	73 |
| Total 	              |  61              	| 158           | 	219  |

## 18.1.1 Expected counts in two-way tables

- If the type of question didn't matter (null hypothesis), then we would expect the same number of disclosures, *independent* of the question asked.
- Overall, the seller disclosed the problem 61 out of 219 times, so we would *expect* $\frac{61}{219} \times 73 \approx 20.33$ disclosures for 73 sellers.

| Question             |  Disclose problem | 	Hide problem 	| Total | 
| -------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ----- |
| General 	            |   2 *(20.33)*    	| 71    *(52.67)* |	73 |
| Positive assumption  |  23  *(20.33)*    | 50    *(52.67)* |	73 |
| Negative assumption  |  36   *(20.33)*    	| 37  *(52.67)*   |	73 |
| Total 	              |  61             	| 158           | 	219  |

## 18.1.2 The observed chi-squared statistic

The *chi-squared statistic* $X^2$ measures how different our actual results are from the expected results:

$$
{\scriptsize
\begin{aligned}
&\text{General formula} &&
    \frac{(\text{observed count } - \text{expected count})^2}
        {\text{expected count}} \\
&\text{Row 1, Col 1} &&
    \frac{(2 - 20.33)^2}{20.33} = 16.53 \\
&\text{Row 2, Col 1} &&
    \frac{(23 - 20.33)^2}{20.33} = 0.35 \\
& \hspace{9mm}\vdots &&
    \hspace{13mm}\vdots \\
&\text{Row 2, Col 3} &&
    \frac{(37 - 52.67)^2}{52.67} = 4.66
\end{aligned}
} \\
X^2 = 16.53 + 0.35 + \dots + 4.66 = 40.13
$$

## 18.1.3 Variability of the statistic

We can simulate $X^2$ statistics under the assumption $H_0$ that the question has no effect:

- 219 Cards
- 61 green (disclose), 158 blue (hide)
- Shuffle and deal into *three* piles, 73 each.
- Make a 2-way table.
- Compute the *simulated null statistic* $X^2$.

## Simulated Two-way table

Simulated and *(expected)* counts:

| Question             |  Disclose problem | 	Hide problem 	| Total | 
| -------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ----- |
| General 	            |   29 *(20.33)*    	| 44    *(52.67)* |	73 |
| Positive assumption  |  15  *(20.33)*    | 58    *(52.67)* |	73 |
| Negative assumption  |  17   *(20.33)*    	| 56  *(52.67)*   |	73 |
| Total 	              |  61             	| 158           | 	219  |


## Simulated null chi-squared statistic

$$
{\scriptsize
\begin{aligned}
&\text{General formula} &&
    \frac{(\text{observed count } - \text{expected count})^2}
        {\text{expected count}} \\
&\text{Row 1, Col 1} &&
    \frac{(29 - 20.33)^2}{20.33} = 3.7 \\
&\text{Row 2, Col 1} &&
    \frac{(15 - 20.33)^2}{20.33} = 1.4 \\
& \hspace{9mm}\vdots &&
    \hspace{13mm}\vdots \\
&\text{Row 3, Col 2} &&
    \frac{(56 - 52.67)^2}{52.67} = 0.211
\end{aligned}
} \\
X^2 = 3.7 + 1.4 + \dots + 0.211 = 8
$$

## 18.1.4 Observed statistic vs. null chi-squared statistics

- We simulate 1000s of $X^2$ statistics this way to create a *null distribution*.
- Then we count how many are *as or more extreme* as our observed chi-square statistic ($X^2 = 40.13$).
    - This is the P-value.
- The distribution only has a right-hand tail, because $X^2$ is always positive.

## {data-background-image="https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/18-inference-tables_files/figure-html/ipodRandDotPlot-1.png" data-background-size="contain"}

## Interpretation

- The P-value is 0.000.
- We have very strong evidence that the type of question asked is associated with whether or not the seller reveals defects.
- The two variables are *not independent*.

# Group Activity: Organ Donation

</div>

## Experiment

Researchers asked *volunteer* subjects to imagine they moved to a new state, applied for a driverâ€™s license, and needed to decide whether or not to become an organ donor. Researchers created *three different versions* of the survey, each with a different donor recruiting strategy. Subjects were *randomly assigned* to one of the three types of recruiting strategies.

1. The default option is to be an organ donor, and individuals have to opt out of organ donation (opt-*out* group).
2. The default option is to not be an organ donor, and individuals have to opt in to organ donation (opt-*in* group).
3. There is no default option, and individuals have to choose whether or not they will be an organ donor (*neutral* group).

## Hypotheses

- **Null Hypothesis.** The recruiting strategy is independent of the decision to donate.
- **Alternative Hypothesis.** The recruiting strategy is associated with whether or not the person decides to donate.

## Organ Donor Data

Researchers found that 23 of 55 subjects in the opt-in group chose to be organ donors, 41 of 50 in the opt-out group chose to be organ donors, and 44 of 56 in the neutral group chose to be organ donors. 

## Group Exercises

1. Open the [Multiple Proportions applet](http://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/ChiSqShuffle.html?hideExtras=1) with the preloaded organ donor data. Click the *Show Table* checkbox to see the two-way table. Select $\chi^2$ from the *Statistic* drop down menu. **Record** the observed chi-squared statistic.

2. Based on the bar blot (or the table), does it appear that the recruiting strategy is associated with the decision to donate? Be ready to give a reason for your answer.

3. Simulate a null distribution of chi-squared statistics. **Record** a *p-value.* Based on this p-value, **record** a sentence summarizing your conclusion in the context of this study.

4. Check the box for *Overlay Chi-squared distribution*. What do you notice?


# 18.2 Mathematical model for test of independence

## 18.2.1 The chi-squared test of independence

- The *Chi-squared distribution* is a mathematical model that predicts the sampling distribution of the chi-squared statistic.
- You need to specify the *degrees of freedom*, which controls how fat the tail is.
    - The degrees of freedom depends on the number of levels in your categorical variables.
    
## {data-background-image="https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/18-inference-tables_files/figure-html/chisqDistDF-1.png" data-background-size="contain"}

## 18.2.2 Variability of the chi-squared statistic

- Conditions: 
    - The observations should be *independent*.
    - The *expected counts for each cell of the table should be at least 5.*

If the conditions are met, then the sampling distribution will be approximately Chi-squared with $(R-1)\times(C-1)$ degrees of freedom, where $R$ and $C$ are the number of rows and columns in the two-way table.

## 18.2.3 Observed statistic vs. null chi-squared statistics

In the Question/Seller example, we had $X^2 = 40.13$ with 2 degrees of freedom.

```{r}
pchisq(40.13, df = 2, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

Or equivalently,

```{r}
1- pchisq(40.13, df = 2)
```

## Chi-squared test in R

```{r}
sellerTable <- as.table(rbind(c(2, 71), c(23, 50), c(36,37)))
chisq.test(sellerTable)
```
