# General Advice 

See the [study guide](https://westmont.instructure.com/courses/8503/files/587724) on Canvas.

- Review the slides and your class notes. 
    - As you review, follow along with the *textbook*.
    - As you review, keep a list of key terms and concepts.
    - Make sure you can answer all the *group activity questions*.
- Review your homework, keeping in mind that these have been graded very leniently and not all of your answers will be correct, even if you didn't have points deducted.
- Do some of the *odd-numbered problems* in the textbook.
    - The answers to the odd-numbered questions are in the back of the book.
- Study the *Chapter Review* sections at the end of each chapter.
