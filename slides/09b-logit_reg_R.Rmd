# Pairs Today

- Please pair up (your choice).
    - At least one person in each pair needs to have a device that can use RStudio (installed or using rstudio.cloud). This person is the *Operator*.
    - Ideally, everyone has an RStudio-enabled device. If you don't, you can still take notes by keeping track of the code and trying it on your own later.
    
## Group Exercises

Do all the challenges.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

## Load and inspect the data
nba <- read_csv("https://math.westmont.edu/data/nba.csv")
view(nba)

ggplot(nba, aes(x = PTS)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(nba, aes(x = PTS, color = TARGET_5Yrs)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(nba, aes(x = PTS, fill = TARGET_5Yrs)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(nba, aes(x = PTS, fill = TARGET_5Yrs)) + 
  geom_histogram(position = "dodge", binwidth = 100)
ggplot(nba, aes(x = PTS, y = TARGET_5Yrs)) + geom_point()

## Logistic regression models
bbmod1 <- glm(TARGET_5Yrs ~ PTS, family = "binomial", data = nba)
summary(bbmod1)

# Write down the logistic regression equation

## Ayo Dosunmu scored 678 points in his rookie year.
## Predict if Ayo will be in the league in 5 years:
predict(bbmod1, data.frame(PTS = 678))
exp(2.242346)/(1+exp(2.242346))
predict(bbmod1, data.frame(PTS = 678), type = "response")
# 0.90

## Challenge: Add total rebounds (TRB) as another predictor in your model. (bbmod2)
## Ayo scored 678 points as a rookie and had 216 rebounds. What
## probability does the model predict? Compare to bbmod1. Does it make sense?

## Challenge: make a scatterplot of TRB vs PTS, colored by TARGET_5Yrs
## What do you notice? Where would Ayo be?

## Challenge: Who is the highest-scoring rookie in this data set? (Use filter)

## Challenge: Try making a model (model3) with more than 5 predictor 
# variables (your choice). Use the step function on your model.
# Does it eliminate any variables?

## Challenge: how could you display three variables in a plot,
# giving some information about 5yr success?
