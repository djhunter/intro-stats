# Section 3.2: 2SD and Theory-based Confidence Intervals for a Single Proportion

## Introduction

- In Section 3.1 we found confidence intervals by doing repeated tests of significance (changing the value in the null hypothesis) to find a range of values that were *plausible* for the population parameter (long run probability or population proportion).
- This is a very tedious way to construct a confidence interval.
- Today, we will look at two other ways to construct confidence intervals [2SD and Theory-Based].

## The Affordable Care Act

- A November 2013 Gallup poll based on a random sample of 1,034 adults asked whether the Affordable Care Act had affected the respondents or their family. 
- 69% of the sample responded that the act had no effect.  (This number went down to 59% in May 2014 and 54% in Oct 2014.)
- What can we say about the proportion of all adult Americans that would say the act had no effect?

## CI using plausible values

- We could construct a confidence interval just like we did last time.

| Probability under null | 0.659 | 0.660 | 0.661 | $\cdots$ | 0.717 | 0.718 | 0.719 |
| ---------------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | -------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Two-sided p-value | 0.0388 | 0.0453 | 0.0514 | $\cdots$ | 0.0517 | 0.0458 | 0.0365 |
| Plausible? ($\alpha  = 0.05$) | No | No | Yes | $\cdots$ | Yes | No | No |

- We find we are 95% confident that the proportion of all adult Americans that felt unaffected by the ACA is between 0.661 and 0.717.

## Short Cut?

- The method we used last time to find our interval of plausible values for the parameter is tedious and time consuming. 
- Might there be a short cut?
- Our sample proportion should be the middle of our confidence interval.
- We just need a way to find out *how wide* it should be.

## Two standard deviations 

When a null distribution is bell-shaped, about 95% of the statistics will fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean with the other 5% outside this region.

```{r, fig.align='center'}

```

## 95% 2SD Confidence Interval

- So we could say that a parameter value is plausible if it is within 2 standard deviations (SD) from our best estimate of the parameter, our observed sample statistic.
- This gives us the simple formula for a *95% 2SD confidence interval* of

$$
\hat{p} \pm 2 \times \text{SD}_\text{null}
$$

## 2SD Method

-  Use the [One Proportion Applet](http://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/OneProp/OneProp.htm?hideExtras=1) to generate a null distribution for $H_0 : \pi = 0.5$, and record $\text{SD}_\text{null} \approx 0.016$.
- Using the 2SD method on our ACA data we get a 95% confidence interval
$$
0.69 \pm 2(0.016)	= 0.69 \pm 0.032 = (0.658, 0.722)
$$		

- The 0.032 in the above is called a *margin of error*.
- This interval is close to what we got using plausible values: (0.661, 0.717).

## Theory-Based Methods

- We can use the 2SD method with the theory-based approximation for the standard deviation of the null distribution: $\text{SD}_\text{null} \approx \sqrt{\frac{\pi(1-\pi)}{n}}$.
- Instead of making up some $\pi$ to use in this formula, we can use $\hat{p}$.
- The approximate, theory-based 95% 2SD confidence interval is 
$$
\begin{align}
\hat{p} \pm 2 \times \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} &= 0.69 \pm 2 \times \sqrt{\frac{0.69(1-0.69)}{1034}} \\
&\approx 0.69 \pm 0.028 \\
&\approx (0.662, 0.718)
\end{align}
$$

## Other confidence levels

- If we want other confidence levels, we change the multiplier.
- The general *theory-based confidence interval* for a single proportion is:

$$
\hat{p} \pm \text{(multiplier)} \times \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} 
$$

- 2 (or rather 1.96) is the multiplier for 95% confidence.
- 1.645 gives a 90% CI. 2.576 gives a 99% CI.
- The higher the confidence level, the bigger the multiplier (need software or a table).

## Software for Theory-based CI's

- The [Theory-Based Inference applet](http://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/TBIA.html?hideExtras=1) does confidence intervals.
You can also get them in R:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
prop.test(714, 1034, conf.level = 0.95)
```

R is actually using a [slightly more accurate theory-based method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Wilson_score_interval_with_continuity_correction).


# Exploration 3.2: American Exceptionalism

## Preview

The Gallup organization conducted a survey with a random sample of 1,019 adult Americans on December 10-12, 2010. They found that 80% of the respondents agreed with the statement that the United States has a unique character that makes it the greatest country in the world.

## Plausible z-scores?

We found that $\pi = 0.775$ was plausible, but $\pi = 0.5$ is not plausible.

1. How many standard deviations is 0.80 from 0.775? (Hint: Standardize the value by looking at the difference between 0.775 and 0.80 and divide by the $\text{SD}_\text{null}$ you found in the Preview assignment.) **Record** this value.

2. Repeat #1 for $\pi = 0.5$. **Record** this value.

3. What can you say about the standardized values of plausible $\pi$'s? 

## 2SD method

**2SD method.** We can construct a 95% confidence interval of plausible values for a parameter by including all values that fall within 2 standard deviations of the sample statistic. 

$$
\mbox{observed statistic} \pm 2 \times (\mbox{SD of null distribution})
$$

3. How did the $\text{SD}_\text{null}$'s you found with $\pi = 0.775$ and with $\pi = 0.50$ compare?

4. In order to compute a null distribution, we need a null value for $\pi$. Does it matter what $\pi$ we choose? 

## 2SD Simulation-based CI

In a random sample of 1,019 adult Americans, 80% of the respondents agreed with the statement that the United States has a unique character that makes it the greatest country in the world.

5. Determine a 95% confidence interval using the 2SD method. Use $\pi = 0.5$ to simulate a null distribution to get $\text{SD}_\text{null}$. **Record** the confidence interval in $\pm$ notation.

6. Interpret the confidence interval in the context of this problem: We are 95% confident that _____ is between _____ and _____. **Operator:** Type up this sentence [using this form](https://goo.gl/forms/v49uZguah6q6HLwu1).

## Standard error of $\hat{p}$

> An estimate of the standard deviation of a statistic, based on sample data, is called the **standard error** (SE) of the statistic.

$$
(\mbox{Standard Error of } \hat{p}) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}
$$

7. Calculate and **record** the standard error for this study. How does it compare to the standard deviations you found in the Preview assignment?

## Validity

> The theory-based approach for finding a confidence interval for $\pi$ (called a one-sample z-interval) is considered valid if there are at least 10 observational units in each category of the categorical variable (i.e., at least 10 successes and at least 10 failures).

## Theory-based CI

8. We will rely on technology to find the multiplier appropriate for our confidence level.
    - In the [Theory-Based Inference applet](http://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/TBIA.html?hideExtras=1), specify the sample size $n$ of 1019 and the sample the sample count of 815 and press Calculate. (The applet will fill in the value of $\hat{p}$.)
    - Check the box for *Confidence Interval*, confirm the confidence level is 95% and press Calculate CI to generate a theory-based confidence interval. **Record** the 95% theory-based confidence interval.

9. Is this theory-based confidence interval similar to the one you obtained using the 2SD method?

## Confidence level

10. Change the confidence level in the applet from 95% to 99% and press the Calculate CI button again. **Record** the 99% confidence interval given by the applet. 

11. How does it compare to the 95% interval? (Compare both the midpoint of the interval = (lower endpoint + upper endpoint)/2 and the margin of error = (upper endpoint - lower endpoint)/2.)

## CI's in R

```{r, echo=TRUE}
prop.test(815, 1019, conf.level = 0.95)
```

## CI's in R

```{r, echo=TRUE}
prop.test(815, 1019, conf.level = 0.99)
```

## CI's and Hypothesis tests

Use your confidence intervals from #7 and #9 to answer the following questions.

12. At a signficance level of $\alpha = 0.05$, would you reject $H_0 : \pi = 0.83$ in favor of the alternative $H_a : \pi \neq 0.83$?

13. At a signficance level of $\alpha = 0.01$, would you reject $H_0 : \pi = 0.83$ in favor of the alternative $H_a : \pi \neq 0.83$?

**Presenter:** Be ready to explain how you can use a confidence interval to determine the result of a hypothesis test.
