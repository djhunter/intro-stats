# 6.1: Comparing two Groups: Quantitative response

## Quantitative vs. Categorical 

- *Categorical variables*
    - Labels/Categories: arithmetic doesn't make sense
    - Gender, color, whether or not something happened, etc.
- *Quantitative variables*
    - Values can be added, subtracted, etc.
    - Usually things that you measure.
    - Age, height, weight, distance, time, etc.
    
## Graphical representations

- *Categorical variables*
    - Bar graphs showing proportions of sample with each value
- *Quantitative variables*
    - Dotplots showing values of each unit in the sample
    
## Notation

- *Categorical variables*
    - Statistic: sample proportion $\hat{p}$
    - Parameter: population proportion $\pi$
- *Quantitative variables*
    - Statistic: sample mean $\bar{x}$, standard deviation $s$
    - Parameter: population mean $\mu$, standard deviation $\sigma$

## Quartiles

- The value for which 25% of the data lie below that value is called the **lower quartile** (or 25th percentile). 
- Similarly, the value for which 25% of the data lie above that value is called the **upper quartile** (or 75th percentile). 
- Quartiles can be calculated by determining the median of the values above/below the location of the overall median. 

## IQR and five-number summary

- The difference between the quartiles is called the **inter-quartile range** (IQR), another measure of variability along with standard deviation. 
- The **five-number summary** for the distribution of a quantitative variable consists of the minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, and maximum.
- A boxplot is a visual display of the IQR and five-number summary.


##

```{r, fig.height=3}
height_data <- c(61,62,62,62,62,63,64,64,64,65,
                 65,65,65,66,67,68,68,69,69,69,
                 69,70,71,71,72,73,75,76,76,77)
summary(height_data)
boxplot(height_data, ylim = c(58,80), range=0, horizontal = TRUE)
```

## Old Faithful Geyser

## Old Faithful eruptions 

How do the five-number summary and IQR differ for inter-eruption times between 1978 and 2003?

![](images/oldfaithful.png)

## Inter-eruption times {fig_height=1, fig_width=1}


|            | Minimum | Lower Quartile | Median | Upper Quartile | Maximum |
| ---------- | ------- | -------------- | ------ | -------------- | ------- |
| 1978 times | 42 | 58 | 75 | 81 | 95 | 
| 2003 times | 56 | 87 | 91 | 98 | 110 |  


<div class="col2">
```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/oldfaithful.png")
```

> - 1978 IQR = 81-58 = 23
> - 2003 IQR = 98 - 87 = 11
> - Less variability in 2003

</div>

## Old Faithful Boxplot


```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ofboxplot.png")
```

## Boxplots and outliers


<div class="col2">
```{r, out.width = "450px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/oldfaithful.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/ofboxplot.png")
```

- A data value that is more than 1.5 × IQR above the upper quartile or below the lower quartile is considered an outlier. 
- Outliers are represented by dots, with the whiskers extending to 1.5 × IQR beyond the quartiles.

# Exploration 6.1A: Haircut prices

## {data-background="https://media.tenor.com/images/8b8df57f08fe3bd6e112951244a6fdd2/tenor.gif" data-background-size="contain"}

## Haircut prices

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/haircuts.png")
```

## Preview

Do women pay more than men for haircuts? Is this a statistical tendency or always true? By how much do women spend more than men, on average? How much do haircut prices vary within a sex as well as between sexes?

To investigate these questions a professor asked students in her class to report the cost of their most recent haircut, along with their sex.

- Explanatory variable: gender (categorical)
- Response variable: price of haircut (quantitative)

## Descriptive Statistics Applet

1. **Operator:** Copy the [haircut data](http://www.math.hope.edu/isi/data/chap6/Haircuts.txt) to the clipboard. Open the [Descriptive Statistics applet](http://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/Dotplot.html). 
    - Check the *Stacked* check box 
    - Keep the Includes header box checked and press *Clear*. *Paste the data* into the Sample data box and press *Use Data*.  Check the *Actual* boxes to show the means and standard deviations. 
    - **Record** the sample size, mean haircut price, and standard deviation (SD) of haircut prices for each sex. 
    - Which sex has the larger mean haircut price? 
    - Which sex has the larger SD of haircut prices? 

## Association?

2. Address these questions based on the previous graphs and statistics. 
    - Do women pay more than men for haircuts? If so, is this a statistical tendency (i.e., true on average) or always true?
    - By how much do women spend more than men, on average? **Record** a statistic, using appropriate symbols.

3. Do you predict that the difference will turn out to be statistically significant? (You will learn how to assess statistical significance in the next section.) **Record** a pair of hypotheses to test, using appropriate symbols.

## Five-number summary

The individual values of the haircut prices that you have been analyzing are:

```
Women (n = 37):
 0,   0,   0,  15,  15,  15,  20,  20,  20,  25,  30,  30,  35,  35,  35,
40,  45,  45,  45,  45,  50,  50,  50,  50,  55,  60,  65,  70,  70,  75, 
90, 110, 120, 120, 150, 150, 150
Men (n = 13):
0, 0, 0, 14, 15, 15, 20, 20, 20, 22, 23, 60, 75
```

4.  **Compute by hand** the quartiles. Then compute the IQR. (Do Men first.)

5. Check your answers by using the applet. **Record** the side-by-side boxplots.

## Applet and R disagree!?

```{r}
summary(c(0,0,0,14,15,15,20,20,20,22,23,60,75))
summary(c(0,0,0,15,15,15,20,20,20,25,30,30,35,35,
          35,40,45,45,45,45,50,50,50,50,55,60,65,
          70,70,75,90,110,120,120,150,150,150))
```

## Skew and Sensitivity

6. Which group (male or female) shows more skew? **Record** how you are deciding, using means and medians.

7. **Operator:** In the applet data, change the male haircut price of $75 to $150. Report the new mean, median, SD and IQR. **Record** the effect of an outlying value on each statistic.
- mean:
- median:
- standard deviation:
- inter-quartile range:
